# utils.py
# This file is for common helper functions used across different modules.
# Add any utility functions here as needed.

# Example helper function (if needed later):
# def format_book_title(title):
#     """Cleans up or formats a book title."""
#     # Add formatting logic here
#     return title.strip()

# Currently no common utilities identified, file can be kept empty or removed if not needed.
